# FizzBuzz In Kotlin

## Introduction
- This is my repo for the FizzBuzz Exercise in Makers Module 3 - Mobile Applications: Kotlin Fundamentals.
- This project uses my new Kotlin knowledge to test drive a FizzBuzz program.

## Objectives
- [x] Test-drive a Fizzbuzz function in Kotlin.
- [x] The function should take a max number and return a string.
- [x] The string should list out the numbers counting up to and including the given max number, substituting Fizz where the number is divisible by 3, Buzz where it is divisible by 5, and FizzBuzz where it is divisible by both 3 and 5.
- [x] On completion, the code should pass the following acceptance criteria:
```shell
CALLING:
  fizzbuzz(100)
SHOULD RETURN:
  "1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, FizzBuzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, 37, 38, Fizz, Buzz, 41, Fizz, 43, 44, FizzBuzz, 46, 47, Fizz, 49, Buzz, Fizz, 52, 53, Fizz, Buzz, 56, Fizz, 58, 59, FizzBuzz, 61, 62, Fizz, 64, Buzz, Fizz, 67, 68, Fizz, Buzz, 71, Fizz, 73, 74, FizzBuzz, 76, 77, Fizz, 79, Buzz, Fizz, 82, 83, Fizz, Buzz, 86, Fizz, 88, 89, FizzBuzz, 91, 92, Fizz, 94, Buzz, Fizz, 97, 98, Fizz, Buzz"
```

## Setup
To run the tests in IntelliJ:
- Run a single test (using the "play" button next to where it is declared in the editor).
- Run all tests in a test class (using the "play" button next to the class declaration in the editor).
- Run all tests in the project (In the file explorer, right-click on the tests directory then select "Run tests in hello.test")
